# Illumination angle correction during image acquisition in light-sheet fluorescence microscopy using deep learning
A deep learning-based approach to estimate the angular error of the illumination beam relative to the detection focal plane. The illumination beam was then corrected using a pair of galvo scanners, and the correction significantly improved the image quality across the entire field-of-view. The angular estimation was based on calculating the defocus level on a pixel level within the image using two defocused images.
